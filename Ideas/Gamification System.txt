Gamification

We have the option to add a gamification element.

We can do several things.

- Every session is a level in which the player achieves something
- That something can be multiple things

	*Destroying a base/monster
	*Watering and growing a plant
	*Making your character run
	*etc.

- This can be done by using different Themes








?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????


Are the themes a choice for the player, or does a player pass several themes?
