Always comment your own code, not everyone knows how everything works when someone else writes it.

6.

Always KNOW what your code does, if you use code from another source (i.e. web) learn the code and comment it, before you use it in the project.

7.

Loosely write the code, or inform your team members when you are adding something interwined. We can't have hours of backtracking everytime someone messes something up.

8.

Code should always work together, not work against eachother.

9.

Always use the following if else format:

if ()

	print ("Hello World");
}

so NEVER do this:
if(){
print ("hello world);
}

unless you intend to change it in the end.
